## time

### Overview

You will learn important skills from these quests:

- **Date Manipulation**: You will practice modifying and working with dates
  using JavaScript.
- **Function Creation**: You will create functions to solve date-related
  problems, strengthening your programming abilities.
- **Understanding of Time**: You will learn how to adjust and calculate time
  based on different formats and scenarios.
- **Validation and Comparison**: You will check if dates are valid and compare
  different dates, which is crucial in programming.
- **Leap Year Rules**: You will understand how leap years work and how to
  calculate them programmatically.
- **Custom Week Structures**: You will explore non-traditional week formats,
  helping you think outside the box.
- **Date Formatting**: You will learn how to format dates into human-readable
  strings, improving your skills in string manipulation.

This practice will enhance your overall programming knowledge and confidence.

#### dr-strange

The goal of this exercise is to create two functions: `addWeek` and
`timeTravel`. The `addWeek` function modifies a regular week to a new 14-day
format, assigning names to the days accordingly. The `timeTravel` function
adjusts the time of a given date based on provided parameters. You will practice
using date manipulation and object arguments in JavaScript.

#### date-is

The goal of this exercise is to create five functions that handle date
validation and comparison. You will learn how to check if a date is valid,
compare dates to see which is greater or lesser, and determine if a date is in
the past or future. This strengthens your understanding of date manipulation in
programming using the date-fns library.

#### get-some-time

The goal of this exercise is to create a function called `firstDayWeek` that
calculates the date of the first Monday of a specified week in a given year. You
will take a week number and a year as input, and return the date in the format
`dd-mm-yyyy`. This will help you practice handling dates, calculations, and
functions in programming.

#### rebecca-black

The goal of this exercise is to develop functions that evaluate specific
properties of a `Date`. You will create functions to check if a date falls on a
Friday, if it is a weekend, if the year is a leap year, and if it is the last
day of the month. This exercise improves your understanding of date operations
in programming.

#### match-cron

The goal of this exercise is to create a function named `matchCron` that checks
if a given cron string matches a specified date. You will focus on implementing
patterns using numbers and wildcard characters. The function will return `true`
for matching patterns and `false` otherwise. This helps you practice working
with time formats and date comparisons in programming.

#### count-leap-years

The goal of the exercise is to create a function called `countLeapYears` that
takes a `Date` as input. Your function will calculate and return the total
number of leap years that have occurred from the year 1 up to the given date.
This helps you understand date manipulation and the rules of leap years in
programming.

#### day-of-the-year

The goal of this exercise is to have you create a function called `dayOfTheYear`
that takes a `Date` as input. You will calculate and return the number of days
that have passed since January 1st of that year. This will help you practice
working with dates and improve your skills in managing date-related calculations
in programming.

#### sunny-sunday

The goal of this exercise is to create a function called `sunnySunday` that
takes a date and returns the weekday, excluding Sundays. You will adjust the
typical seven-day week to a six-day week, where the days are only Monday to
Saturday. This will help you practice working with dates and modifying how you
interpret the week.

#### unicode-technical-report-35

The goal of this exercise is to create a `format` function that takes a `Date`
object and a format string to output a correctly formatted date string. You will
learn to handle various date formatting symbols like year, month, day, hour,
minute, and second. This exercise helps you understand date manipulation and
string formatting in programming.

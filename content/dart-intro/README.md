## dart-intro

### Overview

You will gain several key skills from this quest in Dart programming:

- **Basic Setup**: You will learn how to create a simple Dart program and
  understand the `main` function.
- **Variable Declaration**: You will practice declaring and initializing
  different types of variables, like `String`, `int`, `bool`, and `double`.
- **Data Structures**: You will gain experience working with `List`, `Set`, and
  `Map`, learning how to manage collections and key-value pairs.
- **Function Definition**: You will create various functions, practicing input
  management with required and optional parameters.
- **Condition Checking**: You will implement logic to find maximum values among
  inputs and verify outputs with test cases.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: You will define classes, manage data with
  attributes, and understand concepts such as encapsulation and inheritance.
- **Getters and Setters**: You will learn how to use these to manage attribute
  access and perform calculations in your classes.

This exercise will build a strong foundation for your Dart programming skills.

### Content

#### intro

The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to the Dart programming language
by creating a simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. You
will learn how to set up a basic Dart program with a `main` function, understand
syntax, and execute the program to see your output. This exercise lays the
foundation for further development in Dart.

#### variables

The goal of this exercise is to practice declaring and initializing variables in
Dart. You will create an `Object`, a `String` for your planet's name, an `int`
for the current year, a `bool` for a true or false value, and a constant
`double` for pi. This helps you understand variable types and declarations in
Dart.

#### data-structures

The goal of this exercise is to practice creating and initializing different
data structures in Dart, specifically `List`, `Set`, and `Map`. You will declare
and fill these structures with various types of data, which helps you understand
how to manage collections of items, both ordered and unordered, and how to store
key-value pairs effectively. This experience will strengthen your skills in
organizing and manipulating data in programming.

#### plain-sum

The goal of this exercise is to create a function called `plainSum` that takes
three integer parameters and returns their total sum. You will practice defining
functions in Dart and using them in a simple program to see the output of the
sum when you call the function with specific values.

#### named-required-sum

The goal of the exercise is to create a function named `namedRequiredSum` that
adds three required named integer parameters: `first`, `second`, and `third`.
You will practice defining a function with named parameters in Dart, ensuring
that each parameter is supplied when the function is called. This will help you
understand how to manage inputs in a clear and structured way.

#### named-optional-sum

The goal of this exercise is to write a function named `namedOptionalSum` that
takes named parameters `first`, `second`, and `third`, returning their sum. If
any parameter is absent, it should count as `0`. This helps you understand named
parameters and null safety in Dart, ensuring proper handling of optional values.

#### optional-sum

The goal of this exercise is to write a function named `optionalSum` that takes
two required integer arguments and one optional integer argument. You will
practice using optional parameters in Dart by allowing the function to return
the sum of the provided arguments, even if the optional argument is not
included.

#### max-num

The goal of the exercise is to write a function called `maxNum` that takes three
integer inputs and returns the largest value among them. This will help you
practice function creation, parameter usage, and condition checking in Dart. You
will also be able to verify the output using test cases provided.

#### person

The goal of this exercise is to create a `Person` class in Dart. You will
practice defining attributes and a constructor for the class. By specifying
required and optional parameters, you will learn how to manage data for
instances of a class. This exercise reinforces concepts of object-oriented
programming and prepares you for using classes effectively in Dart and Flutter.

#### circle

The goal of this exercise is to create a `Circle` class with attributes for
position and radius. You will implement getters to calculate the area,
perimeter, and coordinates based on the circle's attributes. Using getters and
setters will help you manage access to the attributes and perform validation or
calculations, promoting good programming practices.

#### university

The goal of the exercise is to create a `University` class in Dart that
demonstrates encapsulation by using private attributes for `name`, `city`, and
an optional `ranking`. You will practice creating getters for these attributes
and understand the importance of keeping certain data private within the class.
This will help you learn how to manage data access and improve code
organization.

#### student

The goal of this exercise is to teach you how to create a class that extends
another class using inheritance in Dart. You will define a `Student` class that
inherits from the `Person` class, adding specific attributes and implementing a
constructor. This will help you understand how to reuse code, override methods,
and utilize attributes in a structured way. You will practice creating custom
classes while applying object-oriented principles.

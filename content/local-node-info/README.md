## Local Node Info

To start, we will create a simple page that displays basic information from our local node.

### Instructions

Create a web page, `localNodeInfo.html` that loads an ethereum library, connects to a local node at `http://localhost:8545` and displays basic information :

- In an element with (`id`=`chainId`), the number ID of the current network
- In an element with `blockNumber` as `id` the number of blocks in the chain

### Hint

You can use any library such as `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to connect to your local node.

Automated tests check for elements with specific IDs, the design is up to you.

Minimal structure:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
  <span id="chainId"></span>
  <span id="blockNumber"></span>

  <script src="XXX"></script>
  <script type="module">
    // Your code
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Local Node Info

To get started, we will create a simple web page that displays basic information from our local node.

### Instructions

Create a web page called `localNodeInfo.html` that does the following:

1. Loads an Ethereum library, such as `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.
2. Connects to a local Ethereum node at `http://localhost:8545`.
3. Displays the following information on the page:

- The ID of the current network in an element with `chainId` as `id`.
- The number of blocks in the chain in an element with `blockNumber` as `id`.

### Hint

üö´ Please be aware that the test environment restricts internet access for security reasons. Therefore, you need to download the library and import it locally in case you used web3.js.

üé® Automated tests only check for the content of elements with specific IDs; the rest of the design is up to you.

üéÅ Here is a minimal example structure for the HTML file:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
  <span id="chainId"></span>
  <span id="blockNumber"></span>

  <script src="./XXX"></script>
  <script type="module">
    // Your code
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## connect-interface

### Overview

In these exercises, you will learn the following key skills:

- **Web Development Basics**: You will create simple web pages using HTML and
  JavaScript.

- **Connecting to Ethereum Nodes**: You will understand how to connect your web
  pages to a local Ethereum node to retrieve data.

- **Using Libraries**: You will work with libraries like `ethers.js` or
  `web3.js` to handle Ethereum interactions easily.

- **Wallet Creation and Management**: You will learn to generate new Ethereum
  wallets and display their addresses and balances.

- **Dynamic Updates**: You will implement features that allow real-time updates
  for wallet balance and transaction sending.

- **Transaction Handling**: You will gain knowledge on how to send transactions
  on the Ethereum network.

- **Working with MetaMask**: You will learn to connect a web page to MetaMask,
  allowing users to interact with the Ethereum network using their existing
  wallet.

These skills are essential for developing real-world blockchain applications.

### Content

#### local-node-info

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple web page, `localNodeInfo.html`,
that connects to a local Ethereum node and displays basic network information.
You will use a library like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to retrieve the current
network ID and block number. The page will have specific elements identified by
`id` attributes to show this information, allowing you to practice web
development and blockchain interaction skills.

#### random-wallet

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple web-based wallet using Ethereum
libraries. You will set up a webpage that connects to a local Ethereum node,
generates a new wallet, and displays the wallet's address and balance. You will
also implement a button to refresh the balance, enabling you to interact with
the wallet dynamically.

#### donation

The goal of this exercise is to create a web page called `donation.html` that
connects to a local Ethereum network. You will generate a random wallet, display
its address and balance, and create an input field for donation amounts. When
the user presses the "Donate" button, the specified amount will be sent to a
specific address. This will help you understand wallet creation, balance
management, and transaction sending using Ethereum libraries.

#### connect-to-metamask

The goal of this exercise is to help you create a web page that connects to
MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet. You will learn to load an Ethereum
JavaScript library, implement a "Connect" button to link a user's account,
display the account address and balance, and add a "Refresh balance" button to
update the balance. This exercise teaches you practical skills for interacting
with blockchain technology.

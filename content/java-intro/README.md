## java-intro

### Overview

- You will learn how to set up a Java environment and create your first program
  with "Hello World !".
- You will practice basic arithmetic operations through creating methods for
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers.
- You will improve your understanding of float operations by creating functions
  for adding and dividing float values.
- You will implement conditional logic by writing a function to check if a
  number is even.
- You will learn to use switch statements and enums for game logic in Chifoumi.
- You will understand string manipulation by creating functions to find string
  lengths and concatenate two strings.
- You will practice checking if a string contains another string and replacing
  parts of a string.
- You will extract and clean substrings using string processing techniques.
- You will learn to check for palindromes using loops and conditionals.
- You will gain experience manipulating arrays using loops and conditional
  statements to process elements based on rules.

### Content

#### HelloWorld

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple Java program that displays
"Hello World !" when run. You will set up a Java environment, create a file
named `HelloWorld.java`, and write a function to return the desired string. You
will then compile and run your program using the provided commands and submit
your files to a Git repository for grading.

#### IntOperations

The goal of this exercise is to help you practice basic arithmetic operations
using Java. You will create a class called `IntOperations` that includes methods
for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two integers. By
implementing these functions, you will learn how to define methods, work with
parameters, and return values. The provided `ExerciseRunner` class will allow
you to test your methods easily and see the output of your operations.

#### FloatOperations

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java class named `FloatOperations` with
two functions: `addTwoFloats` for adding two float values and `divideTwoFloats`
for dividing one float by another. You will practice defining functions, using
parameters, and performing basic arithmetic operations with float data types.
This helps you improve your programming skills in Java.

#### IsEven

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java program that includes a function
`isEven`, which checks if a given integer is even or not. You will implement
this logic in the `IsEven` class and test it using the `ExerciseRunner` class.
This exercise helps you practice defining functions, using conditional
statements, and understanding data types in Java.

#### Chifoumi

The goal of this exercise is to implement a function that determines which
action is beaten by a given action in the game of Chifoumi (Rock, Paper,
Scissors). You will use a `switch` statement to return the correct response
based on the input action. This helps you practice using enums and switch
statements in Java while reinforcing logic and structured programming.

#### StringLength

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java program that defines a function to
return the length of a given string. You will practice writing a method in the
`StringLength` class, then test it using a separate `ExerciseRunner` class to
see the output for different string inputs. This will help you understand string
manipulation and method creation in Java.

#### StringConcat

The goal of this exercise is to write a Java function that concatenates two
strings. You will create a file named `StringConcat.java` and implement the
`concat` method which takes two strings as input and returns their combined
result. You will also test your function using a sample `ExerciseRunner.java` to
verify its correctness and understand how string manipulation works in Java.

#### StringContains

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java function that checks if one string
is contained within another. You will implement the `isStringContainedIn`
function in the `StringContains` class. This exercise helps you practice string
manipulation and conditional statements in Java by testing your code with
different inputs.

#### StringReplace

The goal of this exercise is to practice string manipulation in Java. You will
write a function called `replace` that modifies an input string by replacing all
occurrences of a specified target substring with a replacement substring. This
will enhance your understanding of string handling and functions in Java. You
will also test your function using a provided test class to see if it works
correctly.

#### CleanExtract

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java function that processes a string
made of substrings separated by `|`. The function should extract the part
between the first and last `.` from each substring, remove extra spaces, and
combine the clean substrings into a single output string with spaces in between.
You will practice string manipulation and control structures in Java.

#### Palindrome

The goal of this exercise is to write a Java function that checks if a given
string is a palindrome. You will create a class called `Palindrome` with a
method `isPalindrome` that returns true if the string reads the same forwards
and backwards. You will also test this method using a sample `ExerciseRunner`
class. This exercise helps you practice string manipulation, conditional
statements, and loops in Java.

#### ComputeArray

The goal of this exercise is to create a Java function called `computeArray`
that processes an integer array based on specific rules. You will learn to use
conditional statements and loops to manipulate array elements: multiplying
multiples of 3, adding 7 to values that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, and
leaving the rest unchanged.

#### Main Menu

###### Is the main menu widget on a separate level/map?

###### Does the main menu contain a `Start Game` button that transitions to the driving simulation?

###### Does the main menu contain a `Settings` button for adjusting input sensitivity, camera settings, and control schemes?

###### Does the main menu contain a `Quit` button to exit the game?

#### HUD

###### Does the HUD display the current vehicle speed?

###### Does the HUD display the current gear (e.g., "1st", "Reverse")?

###### Is a damage meter present to indicate the vehicle’s condition?

###### Are context-sensitive action prompts displayed (e.g., “Press Shift for Boost”)?

#### Vehicle Setup

- **Vehicle Physics**:

###### Is the mass distribution configured to prevent instability during cornering or uneven terrain navigation?

###### Is the suspension setup properly to absorb shocks and maintain ground contact?

###### Are engine torque and acceleration curves implemented to deliver realistic speed progression?

###### Does braking provide smooth deceleration without abrupt stops?

###### Are steering mechanics scaled dynamically based on speed?

- **Terrain Adaptation**:

###### Does tire friction dynamically adjust based on surface type (e.g., asphalt, dirt, sand)?

###### Does suspension respond appropriately to terrain changes, including bumps and slopes?

###### Are visual cues, like skid marks or dust clouds, implemented for different surfaces?

###### Does auditory feedback (e.g., tire squeals, crunching sounds) reflect surface interactions?

- **Collision Handling**:

###### Do collisions produce realistic physical responses (e.g., bouncing, sliding, stopping)?

###### Does the vehicle handle crashes at awkward angles (e.g., flipping, spinning) appropriately?

#### Advanced Features

- **Drifting**:

###### Is a drift mechanic implemented to allow controlled sliding during sharp turns?

###### Does drifting balance throttle, braking, and steering inputs to maintain momentum?

- **Boost Mechanics**:

###### Is a boost feature implemented that temporarily increases vehicle speed?

###### Are boost effects integrated with physics systems (e.g., acceleration and steering)?

###### Does the boost feature include visual and auditory feedback?

- **Jumps and Ramps**:

###### Does the vehicle maintain momentum when hitting ramps or jumps?

###### Are smooth transitions implemented into and out of the air?

###### Are consequences like flipping or losing control present for improper jump angles or speeds?

- **Crashing**:

###### Does damage accumulate from collisions, progressively worsening handling and speed?

###### Does a crash sequence trigger when the vehicle’s damage reaches a critical threshold?

###### Does the vehicle respawn near the crash location after being destroyed?

#### Game Loop Logic

###### Can players accelerate, brake, steer, drift, and boost effectively?

###### Are environmental interactions, like tire friction and suspension, dynamic and realistic?

###### Does the player need to manage vehicle health to avoid critical damage?

###### Is there a pause menu available with options to restart the level or return to the main menu?

#### Level Design

###### Does the test level include various track types (e.g., straight roads, sharp turns, off-road sections)?

###### Are ramps or jumps included to showcase air control mechanics?

###### Are obstacles or hazards present (e.g., walls, barrels) to test collision handling?

###### Are surface transitions (e.g., asphalt to dirt) designed to test terrain adaptation?

#### Bonus

###### +Are dynamic weather effects (e.g., rain, snow) implemented to impact vehicle handling?

###### +Can players customize vehicle settings like suspension stiffness or tire friction?

###### +Is there a time-trial mode with a timer and leaderboard?

###### +Are AI-controlled vehicles present for competitive racing?

###### +Is there a replay system to view the driving session with cinematic cameras?
